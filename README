=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I got the idea for this very useful (to me) Bundle out of Simon's
Bundle::SDK::SIMON. Apart from saving me much time whenever I go to a
new machine, it can also serve as a way to show others what I'm using.

I got the nerve to do it after reading this:
http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/26818. Afterall, "What is the CPAN
for?"
